# Sorting-Network-Maker

Generates figures of sorting networks.

## Correctness and Stability

After the network is generated and shown, it is automatically tested with random integers. The results show that all the sorting networks presented are correct.

A sorting algorithm is defined to be stable if it preserves the relative order of equal elements. We can test the stability through 'Settings->Test Example->Test Sorting Stability'. The results show that only bubble sort and odd-even transposition sort are stable, while the rest are unstable.
