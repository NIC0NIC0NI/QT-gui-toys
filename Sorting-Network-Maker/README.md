# Sorting-Network-Maker

Generates figures of sorting networks.

## Correctness and Stability

After the network is generated and shown, it is automatically tested with random integers. The results show that all the sorting networks presented are correct.

Stable sorting algorithms can preserve the relative order of equal elements. We can test the stability through 'Settings->Test Example->Test Sorting Stability'. The results show that only bubble sort and odd-even transposition sort are stable, while the rest are unstable.
